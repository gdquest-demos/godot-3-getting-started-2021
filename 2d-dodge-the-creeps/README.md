# Dodge the Creeps

This is a simple game where your character must move and avoid the enemies for as long as possible.

This is a finished version of the game featured in the ["Your first game"](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) tutorial in the documentation.

This copy of the project is designed to match the video tutorial for this project on the GDQuest channel.
